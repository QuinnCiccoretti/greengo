# Shadows

This example will automatically set up most of the code required for module 5 of the [AWS Greengrass tutorials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/latest/developerguide/module5.html).
As usual, you are still responsible for transferring device certificates with your method of choice. Additionally, on your non-core devices you must install the AWS IoT python sdk.
This is described in detail in module 5.
